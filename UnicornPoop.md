# Project Title
## Unicorn Poop

# Project Description
The term unicorn has become rampant in Silicon Valley. 
Many companies have seen astronomical valuation increases in their run up to IPO, but not all of the companies have performed well post-public debut. 
In our analysis, we seek to understand the performance and ownership changes over time for these companies after they IPO. 

# Research Questions
What is the financial performance for newly-IPOed tech companies, short-term (first year of trading), mid-term (2 - 5 years), 
and long-term (over 5 years)?

How does the ownership profile (i.e. mix of private equity/venture capital, institutional, mutual fund) of the stocks (who benefits or suffers from value fluctuations) change over time for these companies?
